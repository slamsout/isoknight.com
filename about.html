<p style="color:green; font-size:25px">Ive been listening to System of a Down since I was a kid. I believe that they have some of the best metal music in the whole industry. The main thing I like about them is porbably Serj Tankians vocals, its the way he screams. I know every song by them word for word and my favorite albums from they would have to be "Steal This Album" and "Mezmerize". For favorite songs I like Chic N Stu, Cigaro, and Violent Pornography. </p>

<br>
<p style="color:green; font-size:25px"> I orignally found Lil Darkie from my brother before he was popular. I love this kind of music, the screaming just sounds good and I dont know why. He has been my top artist on spotify since i switched over from soundcloud. Ive been a fan of Spider Gang (their music group) forever. My favorite album from Lil Darkie would have to be "Swamp Drained". My favorite songs from him would have to be GOOD MOURNING!, DARKIE STILL CANNOT RAP, MEAN WHAT YOU SAY!, HASH SLINGING SLASHER, and THE WORLD IS ENDING. </p>
